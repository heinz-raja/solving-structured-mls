## Solving structured multi-linear systems


Tensors are generalizations of vectors and matrices, equations containing tensors are called multi-linear equations. These are analogous to linear systems that contain matrices. The following image is a visualization of a multi-linear system.

Here we provide code to solve multi-linear systems that contain a structured tensor (diagonal, circulant or circulant Hankel) directly as opposed to optimization-based methods. The MATLAB package tensorlab is required to run these functions.
